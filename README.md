# ICOnverter

**ICOnverter** is a tiny little C utility that allows you to convert a PNG image to an ICO file. 

## How it's used

`ICOnverter <path to the PNG file> <path to the ICO file>`

Note that this program doesn't scale the image if it's more than 256 pixels in width/height.
Make sure to input a properly scaled image.
