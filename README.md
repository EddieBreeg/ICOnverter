# ICOnverter

**ICOnverter** is a tiny little python script that allows you to convert a PNG image to an ICO file. 

## How it's used

`python ICOnverter.py <path to the PNG file>`

The ICO file will be place in the same folder as the input file. Note that this script doesn't scale the image if it's more than 256 pixels in width/height.
Make sure to provide a properly scaled image to the script.
